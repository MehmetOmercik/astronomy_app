This application is designed to inform the user of the solar system and overall universe in a digestable and aesthetically pleasing manner. it consists of a React/TypeScript frontend that connects to an publicly accessible API (https://astronomyapi.com/).

The domain for this application is: https://astronomyapp.vercel.app but for anyone wanting to experiment with this in a developer environment with their own credentials, please follow the steps below:

## Step 1 -- Setup:

Copy the contents of the .env.example into your .env.local and fill in the values with your credentials.

## Step 3:

Next, install all libraries with your package manager of choice (npm: `npm install` , yarn: `yarn install` etc, I will show npm for these steps).
Finally, run the dev server with `npm run dev`.
